In a controlled lab test of a local DVWA instance, a critical SQL Injection vulnerability was discovered in the web applicationâ€™s id parameter. Automated exploitation confirmed the ability to enumerate databases and extract user credentials, exposing serious confidentiality and authentication risks. Additional findings included outdated server software and missing security headers. Immediate actions recommended: patch the web server, enforce parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection, secure cookies, and deploy a web application firewall. After remediation, repeat the scans to confirm fixes. These steps will significantly reduce the risk of data exposure and unauthorized access.
